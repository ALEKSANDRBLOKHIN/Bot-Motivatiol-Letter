I Used AI to help me generate ReadMe


# Motivation Letter Bot

A web application that generates motivation letters based on a resume (CV) and a job posting.  
Stack: FastAPI (backend) + React + Vite + TypeScript (frontend) + TailwindCSS.

---

## Features
- Upload a CV (PDF/DOCX/TXT) → auto-filled profile (name, email, phone, skills, experience, education).
- Generate a motivation letter from a job posting URL.
- Supports multiple languages (ru, en, fr, es), tones, and letter lengths.
- Profile is stored locally in localStorage (not on the server).
- Modern UI with React + TailwindCSS.

## Installation and Run

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/username/motivation-letter-bot.git
c
d motivation-letter-bot

cd backend

python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac

.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

cd frontend

npm install

npm run dev

## How to Use

Go to the CV → auto-profile page:

Upload your CV.

Review or edit the auto-generated profile.

Go to the Job-tailored letter page:

Paste a job posting URL.

Choose language, tone, and length.

Click Generate letter.

Copy or download the generated text.

Check the Information page for details about security, AI choice, and usage.

## Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Frontend: React, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS

AI: Large Language Model (external API, best chosen after testing)

Build tools: npm, uvicorn

## Justification

Tools that generate CV-based or job-tailored motivation letters already exist, but:

Most are commercial solutions: platforms like Zety, Resume.io, or Novoresume allow users to build resumes and cover letters, but only through a paid subscription model.

Free versions are heavily limited or full of ads: users are often forced to watch ads, accept watermarked output, or upgrade to premium tiers to actually download their documents.

Integration with AI is limited or hidden: many of these tools use templates or very basic text generation. If AI is involved, it is usually behind a paywall.

### My approach

Free and open: the tool is designed as a no-cost, ad-free alternative.

Targeted for EPITA students: optimized for academic and internship applications, where students need quick, personalized letters.

Transparent AI: the backend clearly shows which AI is used, and why it was chosen over others (balance of cost, quality, and speed).

User-friendly: minimal steps (upload CV → paste job URL → get letter) make it much faster than existing platforms.

## Generative AI integration 
Integration choice

For this project, we integrated Generative AI APIs rather than running a fully local model. The backend relies on OpenAI’s GPT models, accessed through API calls.

Why API-based instead of embedded AI

Performance and quality: locally embedded models like GPT4All or llama.cpp are useful for experimentation but have noticeable limitations in fluency and relevance, especially for structured tasks like generating professional motivation letters.

Ease of use: calling a hosted API simplifies the backend implementation, reduces deployment complexity, and avoids heavy resource requirements (e.g., GPU/CPU load, RAM usage).

Consistency: API models provide more stable and predictable results compared to locally run open-source LLMs, which may require extensive fine-tuning.

Trade-offs

Pricing: API calls are not free; however, careful monitoring and usage control keeps costs low. Motivation letters are short texts, making the cost per request very manageable.

Dependency: the system depends on an external provider (OpenAI). In exchange, this avoids the need for complex infrastructure on the user’s side.

Educational perspective

EPITA students are already familiar with ChatGPT as end users, but this project goes further by demonstrating how to integrate such AI into a real application.

The work highlights the engineering challenges: designing endpoints, handling JSON input/output, error handling, managing token limits, and caching profiles locally.

This gives students an understanding of the difference between “using ChatGPT in a browser” and “building software that relies on generative AI at scale.”

### Conclusion

The project uses Generative AI APIs for motivation letter generation, balancing quality and practicality. While embedded models like GPT4All are valuable for research, the choice of an API ensured:

High-quality letters,

Low latency,

Simple deployment.

This decision aligns with the project’s goal of providing a free, student-friendly, production-ready tool rather than a pure research prototype.


## Data Privacy Concerns

Issues:

CVs contain sensitive personal information (name, email, phone, work history).

External AI APIs may process user data.

Data stored in localStorage is not encrypted and may be accessible on shared devices.

Solutions:

Keep all data client-side where possible, and avoid saving files on the server.

Use HTTPS for all communications.

Provide a “clear data” option for users to delete stored information.

Be transparent about API usage and comply with GDPR by limiting storage and ensuring user consent.

## Software Security Concerns

Authentication:

For local use, authentication is not required.

Role Management:

Possible roles: User (CV upload, letter generation) and Admin (monitoring and management).

Security Risks and Countermeasures:

Data leakage → process files in memory, never persist them.

API key exposure → keep keys on backend only.

Malicious file uploads → validate file types and sanitize inputs.

XSS/CSRF attacks → escape and sanitize all user input.
